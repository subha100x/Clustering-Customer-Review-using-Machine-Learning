# Clustering-Customer-Review-using-Machine-Learning
📌 Project Overview  This project focuses on unsupervised learning to group customer reviews into meaningful clusters. By applying clustering algorithms, we can analyze customer sentiments, identify common themes, and gain insights into customer behavior without manual labeling.

🚀 Features

Preprocessing of raw customer review text (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).
Conversion of text into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorization.
Clustering of reviews using K-Means algorithm.
Visualization of clusters using PCA/TSNE plots.
Evaluation of clusters using metrics such as Silhouette Score.
